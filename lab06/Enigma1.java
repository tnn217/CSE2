//The runtime errors were improper notation of the main method and no declaration of the Scanner.
//The logic error involved the calcuation in the if and if else statements.
//The error was in the 1-x part. Since the input was between 1 and 99, it msut be 100-x, rather than its decimal counterpart.
//Also there needs to be parentheses around the 100-x in order for th logic to be applied.
//The remaining percentage out of 1 is only shown for the 5 cases shown in the code(the inputs of 7,41,14,33,and 60)
//The proportion out of 1 for each number entered is calculated. However, there is nothing to prevent the user from entering a negative number or number greater than 100.
